# Create an application that functions like an ATM.
# 1. Write out a list of features
# 2. In the list, mark each feature as 'essential' or 'nice to have'
# 3. Decide what the simplest possible version of your ATM would look like
# 4. Show Bianca or Alex and get their thoughts on whether it should be simpler
# 5. Create a new directory on your computer, initialise it as a git repo, 
# and start coding that simplest version! Remember to add and commit your code regularly, 
# including every time you get something working

#Essential
# Balance
